/* 
This file is a stable path (do not delete, move, or rewname it!)

All native CSS modules will automatically import this file (using postcss-append-string plugin)

To change the app theme, modify the import below to point to the theme.css you want to compile in

This will then be used by Cube components to pull in the theme CSS vars at build time (as it cannot be done dynamically, or globally)

Unfortunately this means no runtime theme switching is a available in react-native like it is in web
